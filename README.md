# üõçÔ∏è EazyShoppy Ecommerce Website

EazyShoppy is a full-stack e-commerce website built using Java Spring Boot for backend REST APIs, React.js for the frontend, and MySQL as the database. The project is designed to provide a seamless shopping experience for users and includes an admin panel for managing products, users, and orders.

## üñ•Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Java with Spring Boot
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Database**: MySQL

## üìÉ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher**
- **Node.js and npm** (for frontend)
- **MySQL** (or any MySQL-compatible database)
- **VS Code** or **IntelliJ IDEA** (for development)
- **Postman** (for API testing)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Database Setup

1. **Create a MySQL database** named `EazyShopy`.
2. Update the `application.properties` file in the Spring Boot project with your database credentials:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/EazyShopy
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
```

3. **Run the Spring Boot application**. This will initialize the required tables in the database.

### Step 2: Create User Roles

1. Use the following API to create roles for user differentiation:
   - **Endpoint**: `POST http://localhost:8000/api/role/create`
   - **Request Body**:
   ```json
   {
     "roleType": "roleName"
   }
   ```
   - **Note**: Make sure to create the `ADMIN` role first, followed by the `USER` role.

### Step 3: Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `admin` and `client` folders in the frontend directory.
2. Install all required dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Install additional required modules:

```bash
npm install prop-types react-hot-toast axios @mui/material react-router-dom react-icons react-slick react-inner-image-zoom
```

### Step 4: Run the Application

1. **Run the Admin Frontend**:

   - Navigate to the `admin` folder.
   - Run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   - The admin panel will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Run the Client Frontend**:
   - Navigate to the `client` folder.
   - Run the following command:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - The client-facing application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3001`.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Additional Information

- **Backend API Base URL**: `http://localhost:8000`
- **Admin Frontend URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Client Frontend URL**: `http://localhost:3001`

## üóÉÔ∏è Project Structure

- **Backend**: Contains the Spring Boot application with REST APIs.
- **Frontend**:
  - `admin`: Admin panel built with React.js.
  - `client`: Client-facing ecommerce website built with React.js.
- **Database**: MySQL database with tables auto-generated by Spring Boot.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **Database Connection Issues**: Ensure the MySQL server is running and the credentials in `application.properties` are correct.
- **Frontend Dependency Issues**: Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json`, then run `npm install` again.
- **API Testing**: Use Postman to test the backend APIs before integrating them with the frontend.
